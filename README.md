# WbLS
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is developing water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) for deployment in the next generation of large-scale, underground physics detectors. WbLS may also be used as a detection medium for the dosimetric quality assurance of radiation therapy. At BNL, WbLS is made primarily of pure water with varying concentrations of liquid scintillator (LS) and surfactant. Metallic isotopes can be added, depending on the intended application. Compared to pure LS, WbLS can be cheaper, more stable, simpler to handle, and have a longer attenuation length, with the added benefit of Cherenkov radiation seen in water to provide directionality to the physics experiments. In order to better understand the optical properties of WbLS, i am measuring its fluorescence quantum yield (QY), defined as the fraction of photons absorbed by a material that are re-emitted as light. The QY is a key measure of the scintillatorâ€™s performance. The absolute QY measurement is done using an integrating sphere setup. The result will be useful in further studies modeling WbLS performance in the anticipated applications.
